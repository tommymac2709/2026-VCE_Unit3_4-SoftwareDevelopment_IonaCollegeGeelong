While programming languages vary widely from each other, data types do not; they are consistent across all programming languages. When programming, it can be important to choose an appropriate data type when creating a variable. It is also important to select the most efficient data type. For example, it is not efficient to select a numeric data type that supports decimal places when creating a variable if that variable will only ever contain whole numbers. Similarly, storing a number as a string is not as efficient as storing it as a numeric data type, even if it is possible to convert strings to numbers.</p> <p>Key Point</p> <p>Data types are consistent across all programming languages. Selecting the most efficient data type is important - don't use decimal types for whole numbers, and don't store numbers as strings.</p> <p>Numeric \u2013 The numeric data type consists of whole numbers, referred to as integers; decimal numbers, referred to as floating points; and date/time, which are stored in integer form. Integers can be referred to as unsigned, which means they can only store positive whole numbers, or signed, which means they can store both positive and negative whole numbers. All numeric data types can have mathematical operations performed on them, including addition (+), subtraction (\u2013), multiplication (), division (/), whole number division (//), remainder after division (%), powers (*), and assignment (= or \u2190). Numeric data can also undergo comparisons such as &lt;, \u2264, &gt;, \u2265, ==, and !=.</p> <p>Text \u2013 Both text and characters can undergo the same comparisons as numeric data types, and depending on the programming language, can also use fundamental data type operations such as addition, multiplication and assignment. An example of text addition is:</p> <pre><code>INPUT firstName\nPRINT \u201cHello \u201c + firstName + \u201c!\u201d\n</code></pre> <p>Boolean \u2013 Boolean data types have only two possible values: 0 and 1. In a programming language these are often referenced with the words 'False' or 'True'. This data type is named after George Boole, a 19th-century mathematician who defined an algebraic system of logic. Boolean data types are very useful for systems that require decisions to be made or conditions to be met. Boolean values can be used with logical operators and, or, and not, in statements where a condition must be met, such as:</p> <pre><code>IF isDark = True AND lightOn = False THEN\n    turnOnLight()\nENDIF\n</code></pre> <p>Key Point</p> <p>Boolean data types have only two possible values (True/False or 0/1) and are used with logical operators (and, or, not) for decision-making.</p>"},{"location":"unit-3-outcome-1/coursework/1-data-types-and-data-structures/a-what-you-need-to-know/#data-structures-kk315","title":"Data Structures (KK3.1.5)","text":"<p>A data structure is a method of organising data to allow particular operations to be performed on them efficiently; in this way, data structures are more complex than data types. The types of data structures used in Software Development are: one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional arrays, and records.</p> <p>Array \u2013 An array is a data structure that contains groupings of data. These elements must be of the same data type, such as character, numeric or Boolean. Arrays can also store groupings of other data structures, such as fields, records or even other arrays. The contents of an array are referenced using an index value \u2013 often an integer starting at 0. Arrays can be considered to have dimensions. A one-dimensional array is a linear data structure where elements are accessed by a single index. A two-dimensional array stores elements in a grid-like format, organised into rows and columns, allowing access using two indices.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>Arrays start at index value 0 in almost all programming languages.

Describe one advantage of encapsulation.</p> <p>Your answer should refer to data protection or reliability.

This protects data from unintended modification by keeping attributes private and providing public methods to interact with the data.</p> <p>8. Explain why generalisation can improve the maintainability of a program.

Justify your answers.</p> <p>(4 marks)</p> Answer <p>a. Generalisation</p> <p>b. Inheritance</p> <p>c. Generalisation is used to identify the common attributes (name and employee ID) shared by all employees and create a general Employee class containing these features. This reduces code duplication. Inheritance is then used to create the Manager class from the Employee class, allowing Manager to automatically acquire the shared attributes while adding its own specific attribute (department). This supports code reuse.</p> <p>10.

(3 marks)</p> Answer <p>Disagree. While both principles involve managing complexity, they serve different purposes. Abstraction is about focusing on relevant features and ignoring unnecessary details when modelling an object - it decides what features matter. Encapsulation is about protecting data from unintended modification by restricting direct access and providing controlled methods - it improves data security and reliability.

This is the first part of the School-assessed Task, involving analysis and design, with the second part undertaken in Unit 4, Area of Study 1.</p> <p>Students are expected to independently identify a problem, need or opportunity for developing a software solution from within their community. They prepare a project plan that includes both student-determined and teacher-provided milestones in a Gantt chart that includes all stages of the problem-solving methodology covered in Unit 3, Area of Study 2 and in Unit 4, Area of Study 1. Details of the relevant problem-solving methodology specifications are on pages 18-23. Throughout Unit 3, Area of Study 2 and Unit 4, Area of Study 1, students monitor and modify their project plans as required. They do not have to use dedicated project management software.</p> <p>A range of methods are used to collect data for analysis. Analysis tools and techniques are used to depict the relationships between users, data and systems and to document the solution requirements, constraints and scope as part of a software requirements specification.</p> <p>Students generate and document two to three design ideas for creating their solution using ideation tools. Evaluation criteria are developed by the students to determine which of the ideas will be used as the basis of the preferred design. These ideas are then fully developed into detailed designs using a range of design tools, addressing the appearance, structure and functionality of the solution. The same evaluation criteria are then used in Unit 4, Area of Study 1 to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the software solution.</p> <p>Students apply computational thinking skills when analysing a problem, need or opportunity and apply design thinking skills when designing the solution.</p> <p>Outcome 2 On completion of this unit the student should be able to document a problem, need or opportunity, formulate a project plan, document an analysis, and generate design ideas and a preferred design for creating a software solution.</p> <p>To achieve this outcome the student will draw on key knowledge and key skills outlined in Area of Study 2.</p>"}]}
