# Area of Study 1 - Software Development: Programming

## Overview

**Area of Study 1**
Software development: programming

In this area of study, students interpret the requirements and designs for developing working software modules. Students use a common OOP language and undertake the problem-solving activities of manipulation (programming), validation, testing and documentation in the development stage.

The working software modules should focus on a range of features within the OOP language. Students are expected to fully develop the working software modules in accordance with the given requirements and designs. This includes the development of a graphical user interface for at least two of the four modules. The working software modules will prepare students for creating a complete software solution in Unit 4, Area of Study 1.

Validation is applied within relevant modules to ensure input data can be accepted and processed. Debugging and testing techniques are applied to all software modules to ensure they operate as intended and internal documentation is written to explain the functionality of each module. Students justify the use of the selected features of the OOP language and algorithms in the development of their working software modules.

Students apply computational thinking skills when interpreting given solution requirements and designs, and when developing them into the working software modules.

**Outcome 1**
On completion of this unit the student should be able to interpret teacher-provided solution requirements and designs and use appropriate features of an object-oriented programming language to develop working software modules.

To achieve this outcome the student will draw on key knowledge and key skills outlined in Area of Study 1.
