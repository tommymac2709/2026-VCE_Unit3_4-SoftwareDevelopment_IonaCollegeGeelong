## Activity Set – Data Types ( KK 3.1.4 )

### A. Multiple-choice review
(1 mark each – Section A style)

1. **Which of the following is the most efficient data type to store the number of seats in a theatre?**
    - A. String
    - B. Boolean
    - C. Integer
    - D. Floating point

2. **A Boolean variable is best used when:**
    - A. A number needs to be stored with decimal places
    - B. Only two possible states or outcomes exist
    - C. A long paragraph of text must be stored
    - D. Multiple values must be stored together in a structure

3. **In most programming languages, which operator tests for inequality?**
    - A. =
    - B. !=
    - C. ==
    - D. :=

4. **A variable price will always contain whole numbers of cents. Which data type should be used?**
    - A. Boolean
    - B. Float
    - C. Integer
    - D. String

### B. Short-answer practice
*(2–4 marks each – Section B style)*

1. **Explain the difference between a numeric and text data type.**

2. **Outline two reasons why selecting an efficient data type is important in software development.**

3. **Describe one situation where using a Boolean variable would simplify decision-making.**

4. **Identify the output of the following pseudocode fragment and state its data type:**
   ```
   total ← 5 + "5"
   PRINT total
   ```

5. **Explain why date/time values are considered numeric data in most languages.**

### C. Coding / pseudocode exercise
*(3–6 marks – Outcome 1 style)*

Write pseudocode for a short program that:

**Requirements:**

- Stores a person's name, age and membership status (active/inactive)
- Prints a welcome message only if the member is active and over 18
- Include variable declarations and appropriate data types

## Activity Set – Data Structures ( KK 3.1.5 )

### A. Identify the structure
*(1 mark each – recall check)*

Indicate whether each description refers to a one-dimensional array, two-dimensional array or record:

1. Stores student names, IDs and GPAs.

2. Represents seats in a cinema arranged in rows and columns.

3. Contains the daily sales totals for a month.

### B. Construct and label
*(diagram / short answer – 3–4 marks)*

Draw and label:

1. A one-dimensional array with five integer elements.

2. A two-dimensional array representing weekly temperatures (days × times).

3. A record structure for a library book containing title (text), ISBN (number) and onLoan (Boolean).

### C. Algorithm challenge
*(4–6 marks – applied reasoning)*

Using pseudocode, design an algorithm that:

**Requirements:**

- Declares a one-dimensional array named scores containing 10 integers
- Calculates the average score
- Displays "Pass" if the average is ≥ 50, otherwise "Fail"

### D. Compare and justify
*(4 marks – extended reasoning)*

Explain two differences between arrays and records. For each difference, describe a practical scenario in which one structure would be preferred over the other.

### E. Mixed-structure design task
*(8 marks – mini case study / Section C style)*

You are designing a sports-team management system.

**Requirements:**

- Each player has a name, position, age and weekly scores
- The coach wants to display each player's average weekly score

**Tasks:**

1. Identify which data types are needed for each field.

2. Describe an appropriate data structure (or combination) to store all player information.

3. Outline the steps required to calculate and output each player's average.

!!! abstract "Extension Task"
    Research and describe two other data structures used in object-oriented programming (e.g. lists, dictionaries) and explain how they relate to arrays or records.
    
    Write pseudocode showing how nested arrays could represent a simple timetable.
