## Examiner Insights (What VCAA is really marking)

**Examiners consistently reward responses that:**

- Use precise terminology (e.g. expected output, actual output)
- Clearly distinguish between:
    - **testing** (identifying errors)
    - **debugging** (locating and correcting errors)
- Link techniques to purpose, not just description

**Weaker responses tend to:**

- Describe techniques without explaining why they are used
- Confuse debugging with validation
- Refer to testing tables as a way to "fix" errors

---

## Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)

### ❌ Confusing testing with validation

**Validation** checks that input data is reasonable

**Testing** checks that a module produces correct output

**✔ Exam-safe phrasing:**

*"Testing compares expected and actual output to identify errors in program logic."*

---

### ❌ Describing debugging too vaguely

**Weak:**

*"Breakpoints stop the program."*

**Strong:**

*"Breakpoints pause execution at a specific line of code, allowing the developer to inspect variable values and trace program logic."*

---

### ❌ Forgetting the purpose of testing tables

**Testing tables:**

- **Do not** correct errors
- **Do not** replace debugging
- **Do** provide evidence that a module has been tested

---

## High-value exam sentence starters (40+ ready)

Use these to structure responses efficiently:

- *"Testing identified an error when the actual output did not match the expected output."*
- *"A breakpoint would be used to pause execution and inspect the values of variables at runtime."*
- *"Debugging statements allow the developer to confirm which sections of code are being executed."*
- *"The testing table provides evidence of testing and highlights discrepancies requiring debugging."*

## Command word decoding (very examinable)

| Command word | What the examiner wants |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **State** | A short, precise fact |
| **Describe** | Characteristics or features |
| **Explain** | How and why |
| **Justify** | A decision + reasoning |

!!! warning "Important"
    If a question says **explain**, listing is never enough.

---

## How this appears in Section B and C

### Section B

**Short explanation of:**

- breakpoints
- debugging statements
- testing tables

**Often 2–3 marks** → definition + purpose required

---

### Section C

**Applied context:**

- incorrect output
- partial testing table
- student must identify next step

**Full marks require:**

- expected vs actual output comparison
- explicit reference to debugging

---

## Final 40+ takeaway

!!! tip "Remember"
    **Testing finds errors.**

    **Debugging fixes errors.**

    **Testing tables prove errors exist.**

    **Debugging techniques show where they occur.**

    If students can articulate that clearly, they are operating in 40+ territory.
