- Scope (boundaries of the solution)

---

### 3. Control Functions - Validation - Errors (KK 3.1.8, 3.1.10, 3.1.13)

Controlling program flow and ensuring data integrity.

**Covers:**
- Control structures: sequence, selection, iteration (WHILE, DO/WHILE, FOR)
- Arithmetic, logical, and conditional operators
- Validation techniques: existence checking, type checking, range checking
- Error types: syntax, logic, and runtime errors

---

### 4. Naming Conventions - Internal Documentation - Debugging and Testing (KK 3.1.9, 3.1.11 & KS 3.1.4, 3.1.5)

Writing maintainable and well-documented code.

**Covers:**
- Naming conventions: camel case, snake case, Hungarian notation
- Internal documentation: purposes and best practices
- Code maintenance and collaboration
- Placeholder comments (stubs)

---

### 5. Design Tools for Representing Modules (KK 3.1.3)

Planning and documenting software design before coding.

**Covers:**
- Data dictionaries
- Object descriptions
- Mock-ups
- Input-Process-Output (IPO) charts
- Pseudocode
