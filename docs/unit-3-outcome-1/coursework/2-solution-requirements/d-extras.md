### Question 4 – Requirements for a School System

**Context:**

Your school wants to develop a homework tracking system for students and teachers.

**Instructions:**

1. Brainstorm and list at least 8 potential features this system could have

2. Prioritize these features:

   - **Should have** (important but not critical)
   - **Could have** (nice to have if time permits)
   - **Won't have** (out of scope for now)

3. For the "must have" features, write them as clear functional requirements

4. Write three non-functional requirements that would be important for a school system
