## Overview

This section covers Key Knowledge 3.1.2 and Key Skills 3.1.1 from the VCE Software Development Study Design.

### Key Knowledge 3.1.2

Characteristics of functional and non-functional requirements, constraints and scope:

- **Functional requirements** - What the solution must do (features, functions, capabilities)
- **Non-functional requirements** - How well the solution must perform (performance, usability, reliability)
- **Constraints** - Limitations or restrictions on the solution (budget, time, technology)
- **Scope** - Boundaries defining what is and isn't included in the solution

### Key Skills 3.1.1

Interpret solution requirements and designs:

- Analyze and understand client requirements
- Distinguish between different types of requirements
- Identify constraints and scope boundaries
- Translate requirements into design specifications
