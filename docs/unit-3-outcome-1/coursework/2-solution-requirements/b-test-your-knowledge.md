## 🔹 Activity C – Scenario Application (3–6 marks each)

(Section C / SAT-style applied reasoning)

### Scenario 1 – School Library App

A developer is designing a web application that allows students to view library opening hours and reserve books online.

- The app must work on phones, tablets and laptops.
- The client requires the solution to be completed within six weeks.
- Students must log in using their school credentials.
- The solution will not allow book renewals in this version.

**Tasks:**

1. Identify one functional requirement.
2. Identify one non-functional requirement.
3. Identify one constraint and describe its impact on the project.
4. Outline one element of the scope of this solution.

### Scenario 2 – Local Business Ordering System

A small café wants a system to record daily orders, print receipts, and track inventory. It must use existing Windows hardware and be developed by one staff member.

**Tasks:**

1. List two constraints that will influence this project.
2. Identify one functional requirement and one non-functional requirement.
3. Suggest one feature that would fall outside the scope of the solution, and explain why.

## 🔹 Activity D – Extended Response (6–8 marks)

(Analytical / Evaluation task — Section C format)

**Prompt:**

Discuss how clearly defining solution requirements, constraints and scope contributes to the success of a software project.

In your response, refer to at least two examples of constraints and their influence on functional or non-functional requirements.
