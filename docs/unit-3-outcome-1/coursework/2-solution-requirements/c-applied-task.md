## 🔹 Task 1 – Identifying Solution Requirements

**Context:**

You have been asked to develop a small Community Noticeboard App that allows local users to post events and announcements.

**Instructions:**

2. Write two non-functional requirements — how well it should perform or appear.
3. Label each clearly as functional or non-functional.
4. Explain in one sentence why distinguishing between these two types of requirements is important.

!!! tip "💡 Hint"
    Functional = actions or features; Non-functional = qualities or attributes like usability or performance.

## 🔹 Task 2 – Exploring Constraints

**Context:**

The client tells you that the project must be completed in four weeks, use existing school laptops, and comply with privacy laws.

2. Categorise each constraint as one of the following:
    - Economic
    - Technical
    - Legal
    - Social
    - Usability
3. For each constraint, briefly explain how it could affect the development or design of the solution.
4. Identify one additional constraint that might appear during the project and describe its potential impact.

## 🔹 Task 3 – Defining Scope

**Context:**

You are planning the first version of the Community Noticeboard App.

The client requests:

- A homepage showing all current notices
- A "Create Post" feature for adding new notices
- An "Edit Post" feature (to be added in version 2)
- A simple design suitable for phones

**Instructions:**

1. Write a short scope statement describing what the solution will do.
2. Write another statement describing what the solution will not do.
3. Explain why having a clear scope benefits both the developer and client.
4. Suggest one example of a feature that could be added in a later version and justify why it's outside the current scope.
