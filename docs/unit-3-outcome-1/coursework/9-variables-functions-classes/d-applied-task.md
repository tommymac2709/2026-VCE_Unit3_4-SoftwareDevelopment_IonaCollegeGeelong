## Task 1: Variables and constants (5 marks)

A program manages an online quiz.

The quiz:

- allows a maximum of 3 attempts
- stores the current attempt number
- checks the attempt number in multiple parts of the program

---

### b. Identify the most appropriate feature to store the current attempt number. (1 mark)

---

### c. Justify your answers to parts (a) and (b). Your response should refer to scope and data reliability. (3 marks)

---

## Task 2: Function or method? (6 marks)

For each requirement below:

- identify whether a function or method should be used
- justify your choice

### a. Calculating the total cost of a purchase and returning the value for further processing. (3 marks)

---

### b. Displaying an error message to the user when invalid data is entered. (3 marks)

### a. Identify: (3 marks)

- one constant
- one function
- one method

that should be used in this program.

---

### b. Justify the use of each feature you identified in part (a). (3 marks)

---

## Common mistakes to avoid (examiner patterns)

!!! warning "Don't Make These Mistakes"
    ❌ Identifying a method where a value must be returned

    ❌ Using a variable instead of a constant for fixed values

    ❌ Confusing a class with an object

    ❌ Describing scope without mentioning accessibility

## 40+ Exam Tip

!!! tip "High-scoring responses explicitly link feature → purpose → benefit"
    **Example:**

    *"A constant is appropriate because the value must not change and this improves reliability."*
