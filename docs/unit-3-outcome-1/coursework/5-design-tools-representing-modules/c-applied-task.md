# d. Applied Task

## 🧑‍💻 VCE Software Development – Student Task Sheet

**Unit 3 Outcome 1 – Design Tools for Representing Modules**

---

## Community Noticeboard App

(Section C / Outcome 2 style, 6–10 marks total)

### Context:

You previously analysed the Community Noticeboard App and determined its functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and scope.

The client has approved development of the first version and now requests design representations of the "Create Post" feature.

---

## 🔹 Part 1 – Data Dictionary (2 marks)

1. Design a simple data dictionary for the "Create Post" feature including at least four variables or fields.

Include: Name, Data Type, Format or Example Values, and Description/Purpose.

---

## 🔹 Part 2 – Object Description (2 marks)

2. Create an object description for the "Post" object, listing:
    - Attributes (e.g. title, message, author, date)
    - Methods (e.g. addPost, deletePost, displayPost)
    - Events (e.g. onClick of "Submit" button)

---

## 🔹 Part 3 – Mock-up (2 marks)

3. Draw or digitally sketch a mock-up of the "Create Post" screen that meets the solution's non-functional requirements (e.g. usability, phone-friendly interface).

Label:
- input fields,
- buttons, and
- layout elements.

---

## 🔹 Part 4 – IPO Chart (2 marks)

4. Complete an Input–Process–Output chart describing how data flows when a user creates a new post.

Include at least one validation process (e.g. check that the message field is not empty).

| Input | Process | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

---

## 🔹 Part 5 – Pseudocode (2 marks)

5. Write pseudocode for the "Create Post" module that:
    - accepts user input for title and message,
    - validates that fields are not blank, and
    - displays confirmation text "Post created successfully".

---

## Extension Discussion (2 marks optional)

6. Explain how producing these design representations supports efficient and effective software development within the project's constraints (e.g. time and existing hardware).
