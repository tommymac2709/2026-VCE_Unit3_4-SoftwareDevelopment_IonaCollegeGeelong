# 3. Control Functions - Validation - Errors

## Overview

This section covers control structures, data validation techniques, and error handling from the VCE Software Development Study Design.

### Key Knowledge Covered

**Control Structures:**
- Sequence
- Selection (if, if-else, case/switch)
- Iteration/Repetition (for, while, do-while loops)

**Data Validation (KK 3.1.10):**
- Existence checking
- Type checking
- Range checking

**Error Types (KK 3.1.13):**
- Syntax errors
- Logic errors
- Runtime errors (overflow, index out of range, type mismatch, divide by zero)

## Learning Pathway

Work through the following pages in order:

1. **What You Need To Know** - Core concepts and definitions
2. **Test Your Knowledge** - Quick comprehension questions
3. **Practical Examples** - Worked C# code examples
4. **Applied Task** - Student task sheet with exercises
5. **Extras** - Additional practice questions

## Importance

Understanding control structures, validation, and error handling is essential for:

- Writing programs that make decisions and repeat actions
- Ensuring data integrity and preventing invalid input
- Creating robust software that handles errors gracefully
- Debugging and troubleshooting code effectively
