# 4. Naming Conventions - Internal Documentation - Debugging and Testing

## Overview

This section covers naming conventions, internal documentation practices, and debugging/testing techniques from the VCE Software Development Study Design.

### Key Knowledge 3.1.9

Purposes and features of naming conventions for solution elements (variables, interface controls, code structures), including:

- Hungarian notation
- Camel casing
- Snake casing

### Key Knowledge 3.1.11

Purposes of internal documentation, including:

- Explaining and justifying data and code structures
- Code maintenance
- Placeholder comments for future development (stubs)

### Key Skills Covered

**3.1.4** - Develop and apply suitable naming conventions and validation techniques within modules

**3.1.5** - Document the functioning of modules using internal documentation

## Learning Pathway

Work through the following pages in order:

1. **What You Need To Know** - Core concepts and definitions
2. **Test Your Knowledge** - Quick comprehension questions
3. **Practical Examples** - Worked C# code examples
4. **Applied Task** - Student task sheet with exercises
5. **Extras** - Additional practice questions

## Importance

Understanding naming conventions and documentation is essential for:

- Writing clear, readable, and maintainable code
- Collaborating effectively with other developers
- Making code easier to debug and update
- Following professional software development practices
- Communicating the purpose and function of code elements
