# Area of Study 2 - Software Development: Analysis and Design

## Overview

**Area of Study 2**
Software development: analysis and design

In this area of study, students prepare for the development of a software solution that meets a student-identified problem, need or opportunity. This is the first part of the School-assessed Task, involving analysis and design, with the second part undertaken in Unit 4, Area of Study 1.

Students are expected to independently identify a problem, need or opportunity for developing a software solution from within their community. They prepare a project plan that includes both student-determined and teacher-provided milestones in a Gantt chart that includes all stages of the problem-solving methodology covered in Unit 3, Area of Study 2 and in Unit 4, Area of Study 1. Details of the relevant problem-solving methodology specifications are on pages 18-23. Throughout Unit 3, Area of Study 2 and Unit 4, Area of Study 1, students monitor and modify their project plans as required. They do not have to use dedicated project management software.

A range of methods are used to collect data for analysis. Analysis tools and techniques are used to depict the relationships between users, data and systems and to document the solution requirements, constraints and scope as part of a software requirements specification.

Students generate and document two to three design ideas for creating their solution using ideation tools. Evaluation criteria are developed by the students to determine which of the ideas will be used as the basis of the preferred design. These ideas are then fully developed into detailed designs using a range of design tools, addressing the appearance, structure and functionality of the solution. The same evaluation criteria are then used in Unit 4, Area of Study 1 to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the software solution.

Students apply computational thinking skills when analysing a problem, need or opportunity and apply design thinking skills when designing the solution.

**Outcome 2**
On completion of this unit the student should be able to document a problem, need or opportunity, formulate a project plan, document an analysis, and generate design ideas and a preferred design for creating a software solution.

To achieve this outcome the student will draw on key knowledge and key skills outlined in Area of Study 2.
